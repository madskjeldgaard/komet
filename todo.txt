Test:
- Test that autopan works

Refactor:
- Move componentmanager stuff into KometComponentLoader and turn it into a Singleton

FXLib:
- add synths for andromeda, musli and datorroplusplus
- prefix/suffix function arguments in parallel methods to allow more of the same effect
- Use specs
- What to do about the fact that if the lib is built for 2 channels you cannot input mono?
	--> Make a mono2stereo converter fx
- Serial processing chain convenience

Docs:
- Write specification for .add - when to use lag? when to use dur?

SynthLib:
- Fix autopan for stereo

Patterns / events:
- Add event type to control KometMain instances
