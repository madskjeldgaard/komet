TITLE::KometSynthFuncDef
SUMMARY::Define a synth for the Komet system
CATEGORIES::Komet
RELATED::Classes/AbstractKometSynthFactory,Classes/Singleton,Classes/KometSynthLib

DESCRIPTION::
This class is used to store and define synths in the Komet system.

It is the Komet equivalent to link::Classes/SynthDef:: with a few extra
features. In short, use this class to add more sound generators and effects to
the system.

In the case of source sound synthesizers (like a square wave oscillator or some
other sound generator), the resulting base function is sent off to
link::Classes/KometSynthFactory:: to be combined with the different panning
functions, envelopes and filters defined in the system. In the case of effects,
the result is sent to link::Classes/KometFXFatory::.

The class is a link::Classes/Singleton::.

CLASSMETHODS::
METHOD::supportedTypes

METHOD::initClass

METHOD::addAll

INSTANCEMETHODS::
METHOD::add

This will call link::Classes/KometSynthFactory*load:: for synths and
link::Classes/KometFXFactory*load:: for effects, which will build the synths and
add the results to link::KometSynthLib::.

METHOD::func
Get the synth function contained in the object

METHOD::type
The type of the synth. This can either be code::\synth::, code::\fx:: or
code::\parfx::.

METHOD::category
The category of the synth.

For effect functions this is very important: It can either be
code::\channelized:: (for single channel effects that are then used on every
channel of the system's sound), code::\hoa:: (which is only used for high order
ambisonics) or code::\stereo:: for stereo functions.

This can be whatever makes sense for source functions. Oscillators are put in
the code::\synthetic:: category and physical modelled stuff in
code::\physical::.

METHOD::channels
Get the number of channels

METHOD::text
A description of the synth as a string

METHOD::specs
An array of specs for the synth

METHOD::play
This will play an instance of the synth for testing purposes. Any arguments you
pass in are passed on as synth args to the enclosed link::Classes/Synth::.
ARGUMENT::args

code::
// Playing a synthfunc def
(
var harmonics = 1;
var freq = 1.0*rrand(80.0, 100.0);
var beatFreq = 0.5;
var dur = 128;

harmonics.do{|harm|
    KometSynthFuncDef(\complex).play(
        \wow, rrand(0.005,0.0),
        \freq, freq * (harm+1) + [0, beatFreq],
        \mainskew, 0.9,
        \mainclip, -0.1,
        \timbreMod, rrand(0.5,1.0),
        \dur, dur,
        \amp, 0.23/harmonics
    )
}
)
::

METHOD::synthdefName
Used to generate the synthdefName when finally calling
link::Classes/SynthDef*add:: in the factory classes.
